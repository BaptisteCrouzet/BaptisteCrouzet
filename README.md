# Welcome on my profile !

👨‍💻🇫🇷 I'm a french and junior developper, specialized in the web.

Yes when I say "web" I mean Full-Stack : PHP, JS, Integration and linux environment.
Always trying to make my work more efficient, use standards and amazing tools in order to save time. That's why I love Symfony framework, PSR standards with PHPCS, Docker/Docker compose and repository automations like Github Actions or gitlab pipelines.
I'm also interested in new JavaScript frameworks such as VueJS/Svelte and more generally JAM-Stack websites.

I'm a VSCode lover too.

🤓 I just can't say "no" to new technologies and I'm in constant technological watch.
