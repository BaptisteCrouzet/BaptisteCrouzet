## Hey you, welcome 🙋‍♂️

I'm a french and junior developper, specialized in the web.
Yes when I say "web" I say Full-Stack : PHP, JS and integration.
My wishes are to make my work more efficient, use standards and tools enbled for all. That's why I love Symfony framework, PSR standards with PHPCS, docker and repository automations like github actions or gitlab pipelines.
I'm also interested in new JavaScript frameworks such as VueJS, using Vuetify and more generally JAMStack websites.

🤓 I just can't say "no" to new technologies and I'm in constant technological watch.

### 🏁 Here you can find my public repositories on wich I contributed :

- [BaptisteCrouzet/DarkTheme-The-New](https://github.com/BaptisteCrouzet/DarkTheme-The-New) - Tired of the basic dark theme of VS Code ? Tired of existing dark themes ? I was like you and I took one and improve it for myself. This theme is dark (oh surprise) but has a darker background, better color in terminal and git/errors are lighters. (1 week ago)
- [BaptisteCrouzet/dockerkosmood](https://github.com/BaptisteCrouzet/dockerkosmood) - A docker system for the Kosmood Ydays project (1 month ago)
