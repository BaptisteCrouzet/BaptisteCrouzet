# Welcome on my profile !

👨‍💻🇫🇷 I'm a french and junior developper, specialized in the web.

Yes when I say "web" I mean Full-Stack : PHP, JS, Integration and linux environment.
Always trying to make my work more efficient, use standards and amazing tools in order to save time. That's why I love Symfony framework, PSR standards with PHPCS, Docker/Docker compose and repository automations like Github Actions or gitlab pipelines.
I'm also interested in new JavaScript frameworks such as VueJS/Svelte and more generally JAM-Stack websites.

I'm a VSCode lover too.

🤓 I just can't say "no" to new technologies and I'm in constant technological watch.

### 🏁 Here you can find my public repositories on wich I contributed :


* [BaptisteCrouzet/Ref-em-all](https://github.com/BaptisteCrouzet/Ref-em-all) (1 year ago)<br>
    Ref&#39;Em All : A website made in order to exercise ourselves on SEO best practices. A project at Ynov School. As a fake SEO agency we had to make a site very SEO friendly.
* [BaptisteCrouzet/Docker-Static-Simple-Site](https://github.com/BaptisteCrouzet/Docker-Static-Simple-Site) (1 year ago)<br>
    A basic docker configuration in order to set up a nginx and php-fpm server. It allow us to get a lets-encrypt SSL certificate via certbot too.
* [BaptisteCrouzet/DarkTheme-The-New](https://github.com/BaptisteCrouzet/DarkTheme-The-New) (1 year ago)<br>
    Tired of the basic dark theme of VS Code ? Tired of existing dark themes ? I was like you and I took one and improve it for myself. This theme is dark (oh surprise) but has a darker background, better color in terminal and git/errors are lighters.

*I have many other ones, but private, sorry !*
