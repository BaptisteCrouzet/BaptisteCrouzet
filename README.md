## Hey you, welcome üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm a french and junior developper, specialized in the web.

Yes when I say "web" I say Full-Stack : PHP, JS and integration.

My wishes are to make my work more efficient, use standards and tools enbled for all. That's why I love Symfony framework, PSR standards with PHPCS, docker and repository automations like github actions or gitlab pipelines.

I'm also interested in new JavaScript frameworks such as VueJS, using Vuetify and more generally JAMStack websites.

ü§ì I just can't say "no" to new technologies and I'm in constant technological watch.

### üèÅ Here you can find my public repositories on wich I contributed :
